This module introduces you to programming, 
the basic skill of every computer scientist. 
Its aims are (1) to teach programming concepts, 
including data types, variables, values, functions,
function calls, parameters, return statements, conditionals, iteration and recursion; and 
(2) to develop your skills in algorithmic thinking, analyzing and 
creating algorithms including sorts and searches; 
understanding and writing pseudocode; writing docstrings and comments; 
and functional decomposition – breaking down a larger problem into simpler chunks.
